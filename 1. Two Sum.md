# 1. Two Sum
[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Approach :

### Better :
in this we use two pointer technique to find the target elements which have sum equal to k

first pointer starts from left and another from right
and traverse the point from right to left if the requires sum is found then return the value else inc the left pointer one place and again traverse from right to left pointer

```cpp
left =0,
while(left <n){
    right = n-1
    while (left < right) {
        if (arr[left]+arr[right] == target) return {left,right};
        right--;
    }
    left++
}
```
### optimal :
this uses hashmap as a complement array

in this we store the elements of array and traverse through array if is fount the complment of the current element in the hashmap then we return the indices the complement is calculated by traget - nums[i]

```cpp
map<int,int>mpp;
int cmpl;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    cmpl= target-nums[i];
    if(mpp.count(cmpl)) return {mpp[comp],i}
    mpp[nums[i]] = i;
}
```
