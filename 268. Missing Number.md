# 268. Missing Number

## Approach :
so the question is we are given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n]

and we have to return the missing number which is not given in  the array

i have seen a prefix sum pattern in this so we found the esum= sum of all the elements in the given array and find the sum by formula osum=  n*(n+1)/2

and the missing number will be osum -esum

## Solution :
```cpp
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {

        int n=nums.size(),esum=0;
        int osum = (n*(n+1)/2);

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            esum+=nums[i];
        }

        return osum-esum;
    }
```
