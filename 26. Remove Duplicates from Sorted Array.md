# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Approach :
so in our question we have to remove duplicates from the sorted array and return the size of array in which we have unique elements

so we traverse through the array from i=1 and take a variable k=1
and check if we found an element which is different from its previous element then we place it in the place of nums[k] and increase the k++
and if the elements are same then we move to the next iteration

when the i reaches at the end then all the unique elements are placed at the starting of array and k is at the last unique element

## Solution :

```cpp
int removeDuplicates(vector<int> &nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int k = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
        nums[k++] = nums[i];
      }
    }
    return k;
  }

```
