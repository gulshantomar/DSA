# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Approach :

we have to calculate the longest consicutive sequence they not need to be consecutive in the array but should be present in the array

### Brute Force :

in this approach we take every element and find its greater element in the array recursively and increase the count and storing the max count

```cpp

```

### Better :

in this first we have to sort the array and we take 3 variables lastSmaller,currentCount,Longest

lastSmaller = INT_MIN
when we found element in array same as lastSmaller we do nothing but when we found element lastSmaller+1 we increase the current count and update the longest max
else we reset the currentcount to 1
and at last of every iteration we update the lastSmaller to current array element nums[i]

after this we retturn the answer longest

```cpp
int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int n=nums.size();

        if(n<2) return n;
        int lastSmaller =nums[0] ,currentCount=1,longest=1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if (lastSmaller == nums[i] )
            else if( lastSmaller + 1 == nums[i]){
                currentCount++;
                longest= max(longest,currentCount);
            }
            else currentCount = 1;
            lastSmaller = nums[i];

        }

        return longest;
    }
```
### Optimal :
put everything into the unordered_set

if element has its previous element present then we not go further inside the loop

but if elem does not have its previous element then we check for its next element and update count and longest until the next element is available

```cpp
int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n= nums.size();
        if (n==0) return 0;
        int longest = 1;
        unordered_set < int>st;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            st.insert(nums[i]);
        }
        for(auto it : st){
            if(st.find(it-1)==st.end() ){
                int cnt =1;
                int x=it;
                while(st.find(x+1) !=st.end()){
                    x++;
                    cnt++;
                }
                longest = max(longest,cnt);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
```
