# 485. Max Consecutive Ones

## Approach :
so in this question we have given a binary array which have entries only [0,1] and we have to return the size of window which have maximum consecutive 1's

i am using two variable prevsum and sum
add new element of array to sum and storing the previous sum in psum and comparing if after adding value the psum < sum the we find max of sum and result and store it to result
else change the sum =0 because for sure a zero is encountered and we have to restart our window

## Solution :
```cpp
int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int psum =0,sum=0,result=0;
        int n= nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            psum=sum;
            sum+=nums[i];
            if(psum<sum) result = max(sum,result);
            else sum=0;
        }

        return result;
    }
```
