# 189. Rotate Array

## Approah :
so in our problem we are given a array and we have to rotate it k places

in our problem in brute force we can store value in temp variable an shift every element by one place and we can run this inside a loop in k times

or in optimal solution we can use rotate array pattern in which
first we reverse the array from 0 -> n
then 0 -> k
and at last k -> n
after these three reversal all the elements are in their correct position which they should be after the rotaion to k places

## Solution :
```cpp
 void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.size();
        k=k%n;
        reverse(nums,0,n-1);
        reverse(nums,0,k-1);
        reverse(nums,k,n-1);
    }
    void reverse(vector<int>& nums,int start,int end){
        while(start<=end){
            swap(nums[start],nums[end]);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
```
