# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

## Approach
so in this question we have to calculate the maximum profit from the given prices array which will be calculated by :

we have to do 2 things but both can't happen at same time
1. when we get the buying price lesser than set price then we update it
2. when we get profit greater then previous setted then we update it

## Solution : 
```cpp
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    if(arr[i]<buyingprice) buyingPrice= arr[i];

    else {
        profit = arr[i]- buyingPrice;
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit,profit);
    }
}
return maxProfit;
```
